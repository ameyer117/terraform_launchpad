To authenticate with Terraform Cloud in your CI/CD pipeline, you will need to create an API token in Terraform Cloud and use it in your pipeline configuration. You can create the API token by following these steps:

    Sign in to Terraform Cloud and navigate to the "User Settings" page.

    In the "Tokens" section, click the "New Token" button.

    Enter a name for the token and choose the appropriate permissions for the token. For example, if you want to use the token to run Terraform plans and apply changes, you will need to grant the "Write" permission for the "Runs" scope.

    Click the "Create Token" button to create the token.

    Copy the token and save it somewhere secure, as it will not be displayed again.

Once you have created the API token, you can use it in your CI/CD pipeline configuration to authenticate with Terraform Cloud. This will typically involve setting the TF_API_TOKEN environment variable with the value of the token. For example, in CircleCI, you can set the environment variable using the add_env_var command:
```
- add_env_var:
    TF_API_TOKEN: <your_api_token>
```

You can then use the terraform CLI commands in your pipeline to interact with Terraform Cloud, such as running terraform plan and terraform apply.
